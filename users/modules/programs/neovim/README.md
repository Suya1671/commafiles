# Neovim configs

## Gabriel (Current)

Custom config using lazy.nvim. To be superseded by weaponized-gopro once [Alpacka](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/alpacka) has a Neovim frontend.

## Weaponized-gopro (TODO)

Custom config using custom package manager if I ever get around to making it again
