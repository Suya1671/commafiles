# Neovim configs

## Nyoom

My [Nyoom.nvim specific config](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/nyoom.nvim). Built to be used with the framework. Since its currently half broken however I'm not using it

## Gabriel (Current)

Custom config using lazy.nvim. To be superseded by weaponized-gopro once [Alpacka](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/alpacka) has a Neovim frontend.

## Weaponized-gopro (TODO)

Custom config using Alpacka. To be made once Alpacka has a Neovim frontend. Will be superseded by Nyoom once its fixed.
